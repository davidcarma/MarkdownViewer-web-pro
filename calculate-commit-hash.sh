# The problem: We need to calculate the tree hash with build-info.js
# But build-info.js contains the commit hash we're trying to calculate!

# Theoretical approach:
# 1. Stage all files EXCEPT build-info.js
# 2. Calculate tree hash with a placeholder build-info.js
# 3. Use that to calculate commit hash
# 4. Update build-info.js with that hash
# 5. Recalculate tree hash
# 6. See if commit hash changed (it will!)
# 7. Iterate until stable (if ever!)
